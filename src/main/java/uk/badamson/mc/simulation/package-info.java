/**
 * <p>
 * A Multi-threaded Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) engine.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>This provides a framework for performing simulations of systems on a
 * shared-memory computer using multiple threads. It is therefore suitable only
 * for systems that can record a complete snapshot of their state in the RAM of
 * a practical computer.</li>
 * <li>It is for simulating <dfn>asynchronous</dfn> systems, for which the times
 * of events are widely scattered, so advancement of the simulated state using a
 * global clock is inefficient.</li>
 * <li>In common with most PDES algorithms, this framework partly enables
 * parallel computation by eliminating an explicit global (shared) <i>event
 * list</i>.</li>
 * <li>This framework further enables parallel computation by not attempting to
 * compute and record a single set of <i>state variables</i> at one point in
 * time. It instead computes and records the full time history of all the state
 * variables within a time period of interest.</li>
 * <li>Unlike other PDES algorithms, the framework does not mandate a
 * <i>process-oriented</i> methodology, although it can be used in that manner.
 * Instead, the system is modelled as composed as a set of objects, each of
 * which has a time-varying state.</li>
 * <li>Unlike other PDES algorithms, explicit message passing between
 * continually running <i>logical processes</i> is not used to perform the
 * computation. Instead, the computation is broken down into a large set of
 * <dfn>transactions</dfn>. Each transaction computes the effect (the state
 * change) of one event.</li>
 * <li>The algorithm of the framework prevents causality violations by recording
 * (state read) dependency relationships between the transactions. The framework
 * is <dfn>optimistic</dfn>: transactions proceed assuming that they will not
 * violate causality, but are aborted if the dependency information indicates
 * that the assumption is invalid. Aborted transactions are eventually
 * rescheduling, to ensure progress eventually occurs. The known dependency
 * information is used as scheduling hints to reduce the risk of thrashing.</li>
 * <li>Unlike PDES algorithms using <i>logical processes</i>, the simulation
 * events (transactions) of this framework may access (read) the states of any
 * number of objects.</li>
 * <li>The framework enforces causality and partly avoids deadlock by requiring
 * that the time-stamps of states read by a transaction are strictly before the
 * time-stamp of the state (or states) written by the transaction. Further
 * deadlock avoidance is done by transparently merging mutually dependent
 * transactions into one coordinated transaction.</li>
 * <li>The framework is <dfn>non blocking</dfn>: if a thread creates a
 * transaction that can not be immediately committed (or aborted), the
 * transaction is recorded and deferred until more work has been done, rather
 * than have the thread block awaiting completion of the transaction. The
 * transactions are therefore suitable for computation by a fixed size thread
 * pool.</li>
 * <li>Only the (state read) dependencies between transactions constrain the
 * order of their computation. Therefore computation of the state histories for
 * different objects can proceed at different rates, if those objects are
 * uncoupled (or only loosely coupled) by dependencies.</li>
 * <li>The framework reduces the memory required to record all the state
 * histories by recording only the changes in the object states. It assumes that
 * the object states will be recorded as collections of immutable objects, so
 * successive states can reuse (share) references to immutable objects for the
 * parts of the state that have not changed, to further reduce the memory
 * required.</li>
 * </ul>
