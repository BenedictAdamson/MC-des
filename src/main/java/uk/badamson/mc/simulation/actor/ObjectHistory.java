     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <dfn>next incoming signal<dfn> is the same as one of the
     * {@linkplain #getIncomingSignals() incoming signals}. It is the incoming
     * signal that has the earliest {@linkplain Signal#getWhenReceived(ValueHistory)
     * reception time}, for the current {@linkplain #getStateHistory() state
     * history}. In the case of ties, the {@linkplain Signal#getId() signal ID}
     * ordering is used as a tie breaker.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Because signals could be {@linkplain #addIncomingSignal(Signal) added to the
     * set of incoming signals} in any order, there is no guarantee that successive
     * calls to this method will process signals in ascending
     * {@linkplain Signal#getWhenReceived(ValueHistory) time of reception}. The
     * <i>next incoming signal</i> could actually be received before some signals
     * that have already been processed as {@linkplain #getReceivedSignals()
     * received signals}: an <dfn>out of order signal</dfn>. But because the
     * {@linkplain Signal#receive(Object) effect of receiving a signal} depends on
     * the state of the receiver, and thus indirectly on which signals it has
     * previously received, an <i>out of order signal</i> means that some computed
     * {@linkplain #getEvents() events} must be invalidated (all the events
     * subsequent to reception of the <i>out of order signal</i>). The method
     * removes those invalid events. The signals that caused those invalidated
     * events will have to be reprocessed. The method therefore moves the signals
     * responsible for those invalidated events from the collection of received
     * signals to the collection of incoming signals. Furthermore,
     * {@linkplain Event#getSignalsEmitted() signals emitted} by those invalidated
     * events are then no longer known to have been emitted, and their effects must
     * also be undone. The method {@linkplain Medium#removeAll(java.util.Collection)
     * removes} those invalidated emitted signals from the {@code medium}. Thus,
     * this method can decrease the number of {@linkplain #getEvents() events} and
     * increase the number of incoming signals.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The effect of receiving a signal will be to add an {@linkplain #getEvents()
     * event}, which is the event of receiving the signal. That event may
     * {@linkplain Event#getSignalsEmitted() emit signals}. The method will
     * {@linkplain Medium#addAll(java.util.Collection) add} those emitted signal to
     * the given {@code medium}.
