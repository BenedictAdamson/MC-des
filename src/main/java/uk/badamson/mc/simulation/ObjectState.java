     * <p>
     * Compute the effect of the next event for the object for which this is an
     * object state.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The method computes the effect of the event using a given
     * {@linkplain Universe.Transaction transaction}. The method
     * {@linkplain Universe.Transaction#put(UUID, ObjectState) writes} the new state
     * for the object using the transaction. If the event creates new objects, the
     * method also writes the initial states of those new objects. The point in time
     * for which the method {@linkplain Universe.Transaction#beginWrite(Duration)
     * writes} those states is taken to be the point in time that the event occurs.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Events computed by this method respect causality: the effect of the event
     * always depends on the state of (some of) the simulated system at points in
     * time before the time of the event. In the simplest case, the effect of the
     * event depends on this object state. The event may also depend on the states
     * of other objects. For those states to effect the event computation done by
     * this method, the method must read (access) those states. The method
     * <em>must</em> use the given transaction to
     * {@linkplain Universe.Transaction#getObjectState(UUID, Duration) read} any
     * object states it needs, other than its own state (which it may access
     * directly, of course). This ensures that the given transaction records the
     * causality constraints of the event. Those reads can be interpreted as a
     * message transmitting information from the other objects to the object for
     * which this is computing a state. The reads must be for points in time before
     * the given point in time. The amount by which the reads are before can be
     * interpreted as the message propagation time or the message transmission
     * delay.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In most cases the new state of the object computed by this method will be
     * similar to this object state. In most cases this object state will be
     * composed from other objects that are also {@linkplain Immutable immutable}.
     * The method should take reasonable steps to conserve memory by reusing
     * component immutable objects from its own state in the new state.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * This computation may be expensive; recomputing events should be avoided.
