# MC-des

Multi-threaded Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) engine

* This provides an engine for performing simulations of systems on a shared-memory computer using multiple threads. It
  is therefore suitable only for systems that can record a complete snapshot of their state in the RAM of a practical
  computer.
* It is for simulating _asynchronous_ systems, that have widely scattered times of events, so advancement of the
  simulated state using a global clock is inefficient.
* In common with most PDES algorithms, this engine partly enables parallel computation by eliminating an explicit
  global (shared) _event list_.
* This engine further enables parallel computation by not attempting to compute and record a single set of _state
  variables_ at one point in time. It instead computes and records the full time history of all the state variables.
* Unlike other PDES algorithms, the engine does not mandate a
  _process-oriented_ methodology, although it can be used in that manner. Instead, the engine models the system as
  composed as a set of objects, each of which has a time-varying state.
* Unlike other PDES algorithms, explicit message passing between continually running _logical processes_ is not used to
  perform the computation. Instead, the computation is broken down into a large set of
  _transactions_. Each transaction computes the effect (the state change) of one event.
* The algorithm of the engine prevents causality violations by recording dependency relationships (reads of time-stamped
  states) between the transactions. The engine uses the dependency information as scheduling hints.
* Unlike PDES algorithms using _logical processes_, the simulation events (transactions) of this engine may access (
  read) the states of any number of objects.
* The engine enforces causality and partly avoids deadlock by requiring that the time-stamps of states read by a
  transaction are strictly before the time-stamp of the state (or states) written by the transaction.
* Only the (state read) dependencies between transactions constrain the order of their computation. Computation of the
  state histories for different objects can therefore proceed at different rates, for objects uncoupled (or only loosely
  coupled) by dependencies.
* The engine reduces the memory required to record all the state histories by recording only the changes in the object
  states. It assumes that the object states will be recorded as collections of immutable objects. Successive states then
  can reuse (share) references to immutable objects for unchanged parts of the state, to further reduce the memory
  required.
